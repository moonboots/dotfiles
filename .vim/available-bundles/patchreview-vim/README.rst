Introduction
============

The Patch Review plugin allows easy single or multipatch code or diff reviews.

It opens each affected (modified/added/deleted) file in the patch or in a
version controlled workspace diff in a diff view in a separate tab.

VIM provides the ``:diffpatch`` command to do single file reviews but can not
handle patch files containing multiple patches as is common with software
development projects.  This plugin provides that missing functionality.

It also does not pollute the workspace like ``:diffpatch`` does by writing
files in the workspace.

It does automatic diff generation for various version control systems by
running their respective diff commands.

Requirements
============

1. Vim 7.0 or higher built with +diff option.

2. A gnu compatible patch command installed. This is the standard patch command
   on any Linux, Mac OS X, \*BSD, Cygwin or /usr/bin/gpatch on newer
   Solaris/OpenSolairs.

   For Windows, UnxUtils ( http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ ) provides a
   compatible patch implementation. However, you might need to set::

      let g:patchreview_patch_needs_crlf = 1

   in your .vimrc file.


Installation
============

Option 1: Use a bundle manager
------------------------------

Use your favorite vim package manager to install from the github repository for
the project.

Example 1: Installation with NeoBundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

      NeoBundle 'junkblocker/patchreview-vim'

Example 2: Installation with vundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

      Bundle "junkblocker/patchreview-vim"

Option 2: Install by hand
-------------------------

1) Extract the zip in your ``$HOME/.vim`` or ``$VIM/vimfiles`` directory and
   restart vim. The  directory location relevant to your platform can be seen
   by running::

      :help add-global-plugin

   in vim.

   Alternatively, if installing from extracted form, copy the directories by
   hand::

      % cp -r autoload doc plugin $HOME/.vim/

2) Generate help tags to use help::

     :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc

   or, for example on Windows if you installed under ``$VIM/vimfiles``::

     :helptags $VIM/vimfiles/doc

   etc.


Usage
=====

Reviewing current changes in your workspace::

      :DiffReview

Reviewing staged git changes::

      :DiffReview git staged --no-color -U5

Reviewing a patch::

      :PatchReview some.patch

Reviewing a previously applied patch (AKA reverse patch review)::

      :ReversePatchReview some.patch

See::

      :h patchreview

for usage details.

Limitations
===========

The plugin can not handle diffs/patches which change the line ending types between DOS, UNIX and Mac etc.
This is a general patching problem and is not specific to this plugin only.
